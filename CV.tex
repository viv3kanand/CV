%\section*{Summary}

%I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Western Australian working on single cell transcriptomics. Prior to this position, I was working on the analysis of whole exome sequencing in patients with rare genetic disorders at the Telethon Kids Institute. During my PhD I was a Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher in the lab of Piero Carninci in RIKEN Yokohama and was working primarily on the analysis of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing data sets. I have also worked as a bioinformatician at the University of Queensland and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.
